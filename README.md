# Wallpaper APi

## Starting up and usage
After starting the application, you can use it on: 
http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/index.html

It has one endpoint for uploading the input file, and it gives back all the needed calculations.

## Notes
I've ordered the second list (the list of reoccurring rooms, for the sake of visibility).
Added some validation, for the lines so it must contain the three numbers separated by an "x" character.
Also added minor exception handling.

Wanted to add unit tests but, I had no time.
